Welcome to the comprehensive guide on setting up the configuration for your game engine. This setup is designed to provide a highly flexible, organized, and understandable structure to configure various game parameters, events, and contexts. Let's dive in!
1. Defining Game Configuration Structure:

Your game configuration structure is defined using Rust with a series of nested structs, which will form the basis for configuring various game parameters. Hereâ€™s an outline of how to do it:

rust

#[derive(Configuration)]
struct GameConfig {
    player: PlayerConfig,
    enemy: EnemyConfig,
    // ...other configurations
}

    Annotations:
        #[derive(Configuration)] tells the system that GameConfig is the main configuration structure.
        #[configurable], #[validate], and #[default] are annotations used for individual properties within the structs to specify which properties are configurable, their validation rules, and default values respectively.

Example: Defining Player and Enemy Configuration

rust

struct PlayerConfig {
    #[configurable]
    #[validate([range(1..=100), using = validate_health])]
    #[default(100)]
    health: Result<i32, ValidationError>,

    // ...other player configurations...
}

struct EnemyConfig {
    #[configurable]
    #[validate([range(1..=100), using = validate_evilness])]
    #[default(50)]
    evilness: Result<i32, ValidationError>,

    // ...other enemy configurations...
}

2. Namespacing:

Namespaces in your configuration structure should mirror the directory structure of your DSL scripts. This setup allows scripts named after a particular namespace to access properties within that namespace without needing fully qualified names, making scripts cleaner and more readable.
Example:

plaintext

DSL: /scripts/player.dsl
...
config.player.health = 5; // No need for full qualification
...
DSL: /scripts/random.dsl
...
config.player.health = 5; // Requires full qualification as there's no config.random
...

3. Explicit Override Mechanism:

When a script needs to access or mutate a property outside its namespace, it must use an explicit override mechanism. This can be done in two ways:

    Using #[override] annotation:

plaintext

#[override]
config.enemy.evilness = 12;

    Using an override block:

plaintext

override {
     config.enemy.evilness = 12;
     config.world.size = 3;
}

4. Events and Context:

Events can be defined and added to the runtime, along with custom context objects that scripts can ask for.

rust

let mut runtime = Runtime::new();
runtime.set_config(GameConfig::new());
runtime.add_context("SomeType", some_concrete_object);
runtime.add_event("EventName", ["SomeType", "Player"]);

5. DSL Scripting:

DSL scripts are where game parameters are set and manipulated. They can include properties, anonymous and named functions, events, doctests, standalone tests, and documentation.

plaintext

// Example DSL script: /scripts/player.dsl

#[override]
config.enemy.evilness = 12;

override {
     config.world.size = 3;
}

// ... other DSL script content ...

Now you have the basics to set up a configuration for your game engine. Ensure to leverage the provided annotations, namespacing, override mechanisms, and DSL scripting to create a robust and highly configurable game setup. Happy gaming!
