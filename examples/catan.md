Creating a configuration setup and Zindle for a game like Settlers of Catan involves multiple aspects such as managing players, resources, trade, and development cards. Below is a simplified configuration setup and DSL to demonstrate some of these elements:

## Configuration Setup

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Validate)]
struct GameConfig {
    player_count: u8,

    #[configurable]
    #[default(10)]
    winning_score: u8,

    #[namespace]
    trade: TradeConfig,
}

struct TradeConfig {
    /// How many resources you need to trade to the bank for a single resource
    #[configurable]
    #[validate([using = trade_ratio_validator])]
    #[default(4)]
    trade_ratio: u8,
    // ... other trade configurations ...
}
```

## Zindle Script
```
#[namespace]
// Change the winning score based on the number of players
winning_score = (self: Self) {
    match self.player_count {
        2 => 8,
        3 | 4 | 5 => 10,
        > 6 => 12,
    }
} 

#[override]
// Allow trading 3 items to the bank for 1 item.
config.trade.trade_ratio = 3;

#[priorty = 2]
event OnResourceAllocation (self: Self, config: Config, resources: mut Resources) {
    if config.player_count > 5 {
        // If more than 5 players, everyone gets lumber every time
        for player in resources.player {
            player.add_resource(Resources::Lumber);
        }
    }    

    resources
}
```
